# question 1

# name is a let variable that stores the input, which is basically an alert

# the input is a function that asks a user for them Name

# name = input('Name: ')

# When we print hello + name we are concatenating two strings together just like javascript.

# i beleive once we type in the input value i.e 'Anthoy' the name variable gets replace with my Name
# effectly then printing 'Hello, username ('Anthony')

# print('Hello, ' + name)


# question 2


# so this will do exactly the same thing as before but with formatted strings

# this is exactly the same as in react with `${}`, just with the dollar sign replaced with f

# name = input('Name: ')

# print(f'Hello, {name}')


# question 3
